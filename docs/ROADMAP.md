# Development Roadmap

> ⚠️ **This document is deprecated.** The active development plan is now at [plans/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md](plans/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md).

---

## Summary

RepoBeacon development has been consolidated into a **2-phase plan**:

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Phase 1** | Working Extension (MVP) - Restructure repo, core extension, 3 animations | 🔲 Not Started |
| **Phase 2** | Full Release - All 15 animations, integrations, marketplace | 🔲 Not Started |

See the [Development Plan](plans/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md) for:
- Detailed task breakdowns
- Target repo structure
- Open questions to address
- Timeline estimates

## Historical Context

The original roadmap had 7 phases (0-6 plus future work). This has been consolidated because:

1. The original phases were too granular for a solo project
2. Having a clear MVP milestone (Phase 1) focuses initial development
3. "Ship something usable" before perfecting integrations

### Original Phases → New Mapping

| Original | New Location |
|----------|--------------|
| Phase 0: Foundation | Phase 1.1, 1.2 |
| Phase 1: Core Functionality | Phase 1.3, 1.4 |
| Phase 2: Smart Defaults | Phase 2.2 |
| Phase 3: Project Manager Integration | Phase 2.3 |
| Phase 4: Peacock Integration | Phase 2.3 |
| Phase 5: Polish & UX | Phase 2.4 |
| Phase 6: Marketplace Launch | Phase 2.5 |
